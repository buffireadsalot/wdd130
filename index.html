    <p>Hello! My name is Annela Buffin, and I live in Angier, North Carolina. It is a small town in the south of Raleigh. I have just finished my bachelorâ€™s in applied health and am looking for work, and until I find a job, I thought I would continue my education in Web Development and Programming. I have two children who live in Nevada and Arizona. I also have two fur babies, Kanga, a Great Dane, and Jefe, a Xoloitzcuintle.</p>
